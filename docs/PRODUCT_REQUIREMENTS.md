🎯 Product Vision

Vendora is a mobile-first Reseller Operating System that allows independent sellers to:

Track inventory

Accept payments

Send invoices

Calculate real profit

Operate independently of marketplaces like StockX

Vendora must work even if the product does not exist on major resale platforms.

👤 Target User

Primary User:

Independent reseller

Instagram brand seller

Boutique clothing seller

Sneaker reseller

Current behavior:

🧩 Core Problem

Resellers lack a unified system that connects:

Inventory + Payments + Profit + Invoicing

Existing tools:

Depend on marketplace pricing

Don’t support niche brands

Don’t track real net profit

Don’t integrate payment clarity

🔑 Core User Loop
