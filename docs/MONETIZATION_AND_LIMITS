🔥 Partner Add-On (+$5/month)

Partner is NOT a standalone subscription tier.
It is an add-on flag that requires an active Pro subscription.

If Pro subscription lapses, Partner benefits are suspended until Pro is restored.

Requires:

Active Pro subscription

Trust eligibility

Includes:

Verified badge

Seller profile page

Profile highlight

Priority support

🧠 Schema Representation

subscription_tier: 'free' | 'pro'
is_partner: boolean (default false)

Partner is stored as a boolean flag, not a tier value.
This prevents invalid states like "partner without pro."

🚦 Enforcement Logic

On item creation:

Check item count vs tier limit (Free = 25)

On Stripe connect attempt:

Require Pro

On barcode usage:

Require Pro

On seller profile activation:

Require is_partner = true AND subscription_tier = 'pro'

On Partner activation:

Verify subscription_tier = 'pro'
If not Pro, reject with upgrade prompt

On Pro subscription lapse:

Suspend Partner benefits (is_partner remains true, but gated)

🔁 Upgrade Flow

If limit hit:

Show upgrade modal

Explain benefits

Link to Stripe subscription

No silent blocking.
